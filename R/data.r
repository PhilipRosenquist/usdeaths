#' Mortality multiple cause data layouts
#'
#' Metadata tables describing the fixed-width file layout for US mortality
#' multiple cause datasets from the CDC NCHS. Each object covers one data year
#' and contains the column positions, types, and code mappings needed to parse
#' the corresponding fixed-width file.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 7 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{name}{Column name}
#'   \item{start}{Start position in fixed-width file}
#'   \item{end}{End position in fixed-width file}
#'   \item{size}{Field width in characters}
#'   \item{type}{Data type: "int" or "str"}
#'   \item{description}{Human-readable field description}
#'   \item{codes}{Pipe-delimited key=label pairs for coded fields, empty string if none}

NULL

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note This is an early year with limited coding — several fields left blank.
"data_multiple_mortality_1969"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note This year introduced a revised race classification schema.
#' @note Additional cause of death fields were added to the layout this year.
"data_multiple_mortality_2023"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Both 1989 and 2003 education revision fields are present. Bridged-race
#'   variables are the only race summary fields; \code{race_recode_40} is absent.
#' @note Occupation and industry fields are absent. \code{method_of_disposition}
#'   uses a simplified code set (Burial, Cremation, Other, Unknown only).
"data_multiple_mortality_2017"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Both education revision fields are present, though the 1989 field is
#'   blank in practice as all states completed the 2003 transition this year.
#' @note \code{race_recode_40} is introduced alongside the existing bridged-race
#'   variables. Occupation and industry fields are absent.
"data_multiple_mortality_2018"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Layout is structurally identical to 2018. Five records were corrected
#'   in a March 2021 re-release, recoding erroneous terrorism firearm deaths to \code{X95}.
#' @note \code{method_of_disposition} retains the simplified code set from
#'   2017–2018; occupation and industry fields are absent.
"data_multiple_mortality_2019"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Occupation and industry fields are introduced for the first time, with
#'   data from 46 participating states coded to 2012 Census classifications via NIOSH.
#' @note This is the first year in which COVID-19 (\code{U07.1}) appears as a
#'   cause of death and is included as a rankable cause in the recode lists.
"data_multiple_mortality_2020"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note The \code{record_type} field is introduced at position 19. The 1989
#'   education revision field is removed, as is the full bridged-race variable block.
#' @note \code{race_recode_40} is now the sole race summary field, using the
#'   1997 OMB standard. Occupation and industry fields are retained.
"data_multiple_mortality_2021"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Layout follows the 2021 structure with \code{record_type}, 2003-only
#'   education, and \code{race_recode_40} as the sole race summary field.
#' @note Occupation and industry fields are retained.
"data_multiple_mortality_2022"

#' @rdname mortality_layouts
#' @note Layout follows the 2021–2022 structure with \code{record_type}, 2003-only
#'   education, and \code{race_recode_40} as the sole race summary field.
#' @note Occupation and industry fields are retained.
